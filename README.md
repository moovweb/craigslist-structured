# Craigslist - Structural

While this project doesn't change much of the face of Craigslist, it illustrates how to set up a project including mappings, page-specific styling, and spriting of images.

You can follow along with how this project is generated on the [complex site transformation](http://beta.moovweb.com/learn/training/foundation/complex_transformation) tutorial.

## Basics
